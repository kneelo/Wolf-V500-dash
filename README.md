# Wolf-V500-dash
A dash and datalogger for the wolf v500 ECU based on the arduino mega

See the hardware description in the arduino sketch.

This currently also has code for a lap timer that isn't working properly yet... i'm not really sure why and I am not working working its development at the moment.  

There is also a couple of extra analog sensors that I have connected to the aux inputs for fuel and oil pressure I think.  These wont work properly.
